# **My Story**

Hello Everyone! My name is **Indrajit Singh** and I am a **Senior Software Engineer** and **AI Researcher**. I love to explore new technologies, learn things and help others learn.

> "I have complete faith in the **focus and the energy** that drives me to do greater things in life and that's my intention and love towards executing any task. Instead of just applying for a job randomly I keep my faith in creating interest and attention towards the job"

I started learning C programming and database concepts during my school days (back in 2008) and since then I have developed a strong interest and knowledge in the field of Information Technology. Those days the resources were very limited to learn these technologies and we were only dependent on teachers & offline library books. As years passed by, I got more involved in learning about computer programming, databases and Linux based operating systems which eventually helped me to choose Information Technology in my bachelorâ€™s.

Reasons:
- its great.
- its a test.

## Other thoughts

This is great.
